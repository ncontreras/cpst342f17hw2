Comparison of My Grid vs. Bootstrap:
	I enjoyed using my own grid over Bootstrap. It took me several hours to understand the concept of grids and especially to visualize them on the screen. Once I began to write out the code I found it much easier to apply changes to my site.

	I can see why Bootstrap would be far more appealing to developers, but I felt like it was more of a hassle. There's just something about writing my own code and understanding how each ruleset works that makes me feel more comfortable about my site. I think it took me longer to update my author/about site because I had to query bootstrap, find out what styling options they had for me to work with, and find out how to apply the code to my file. The other reason why I found it more challenging is because I didn't fully understand the code. I felt like I was copying and pasting w/o really knowing what I was doing. I certainly don't feel like I gained any knowledge from it.
